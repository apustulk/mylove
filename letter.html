        <p id="letter">Growing up, I always dreamed about who I would eventually date. I had crushes throughout my school years, but none stuck longer than a few months. I never even had a "romantic encounter" until sophomore year when Larry asked me out over text. But, from the moment I saw your face in the tiny square box on Zoom, I knew you were the one.
	<br>
	Okay maybe not exactly, but let me explain.
	<br>
	You seeeeee, it all started because I believed it always made life more interesting when I had a little crush, so freshman year me chose you. You were incredibly intelligent, wrote witty comments in the chat, had a beautiful smile, and proved to be tough competition during Spanish Kahoots. While my freshman year crush wasn‚Äôt much more than giggly, innocent feelings, it was the start to a lifetime of feeling a whirlwind of emotions. When we started school in person sophomore year, my crush only grew. As I saw you interact with your friends, excel in classes, and very occasionally, when we spoke, I realized just how genuine, kind, funny, and easy to talk to you were. I remember at the beginning of the year, we were placed in the same room for the PSAT, and I bravely sat down next to you, asking for a pencil. I was basically kicking my feet during that whole test, as you were casually earning yourself a full ride to the University of Tulsa.
	<br>
	Emma persuaded me to join robotics in the fall, and thank god she did. As I wrote in your V-day card recently, the times spent one-on-one in the robotics room are some of my most favorite memories. We were able to talk, joke, and spend far too much time together in that tiny room. In the end, maybe it was Mackie‚Äôs ‚Äúshit to do‚Äù that brought us together in the end. We even wrote a children‚Äôs book together! Particularly, I remember one time when we were workshopping our book with Lance, and you said something about wanting to be a statistician and for some reason, I found it to be the funniest thing ever and couldn‚Äôt stop laughing. Another time I remember was when I told you I had to stay at robotics til 7, so you kindly texted your mom to get picked up later yourself. Then, we walked down the hall to perform some type of errand; you allege that I was ‚Äúwalking extra close‚Äù to you, but I don‚Äôt know about allat.
	<br>
	Now, I don‚Äôt know your full side of the story, but from what I remember you saying, you started liking me around November/December of sophomore year. I‚Äôm pretty sure I remember one time I yawned in Honors English class and then you also yawned, so I took that as a sign that you had to like me back. But hey! Apparently it was true.
	<br>
	Looking back, there were definitely a few signs that you liked me, but I thought it was just wishful thinking on my part. I remember one time, Maya Grimley and I were looking at the theater calendar in the red hallway. I pointed out that Coming Home, Yvette‚Äôs sister‚Äôs wedding, and my birthday were all on the same day. Maya Grimley giggled and ran over to whisper something in your ear. I blushed and walked off.
	<br>
	By January I was down irrevocably bad. Right Down the Line was playing on REPEAT every chance I had. You asking me out was the best thing that ever happened to me. Thank god you did, because I‚Äôm not sure if I would‚Äôve worked up the courage to.
	<br>
	Even though you lowkey ditched me halfway through the dance lol, I never held it against you. I trusted and understood that it was because of the loud music and flashing lights, not because of me (fuck school dances). And I‚Äôm so glad we‚Äôve been able to build our trust even more throughout the years. Sometimes, I look back at pictures of us in the early few months of our relationship. We look so young and inexperienced, but at the time, I felt like I had already been with you for forever. You came in to my life, and within a few months, you became a part of me. Experiencing love this strong and true so young is something most people don‚Äôt get to experience. And I count myself so so lucky every day to have you.
	<br>
	Like I said in the beginning, I always dreamed about who I would eventually date. In my notes app on April 11, 2021, I wrote what I thought my ideal type was:
	<br>
	‚Ä¢ Taller than me
	<br>
	‚Ä¢ Laughs at my jokes
	<br>
	‚Ä¢ Good sense of humor
	<br>
	‚Ä¢ Basic hygiene
	<br>
	‚Ä¢ Basic human decency
	<br>
	‚Ä¢ Smart/nerdy
	<br>
	‚Ä¢ Thoughtful
	<br>
	‚Ä¢ Into music in some ways
	<br>
	‚Ä¢ Will take me on coffee dates
	<br>
	And Erik, <b>you are all of that and so so so much more. You‚Äôre better than any person I could ever dream of.</b> I know I love to reminisce on the past (it really just makes me so happy to look back on) and dream of the future, but I cherish every single present moment with you too. I‚Äôm so glad we‚Äôve gotten to grow together through big life changes, and I appreciate you every day for being so understanding and loving. You‚Äôre my biggest supporter and always the first person I tell when anything exciting happens, and I wholeheartedly love hearing your accomplishments or even just about your day. Beyond that, you‚Äôre also just a genuinely interesting and captivating person. I‚Äôd rather spend a day talking to you than anything else. You have so much drive and ambition, whether you believe it or not. It‚Äôs shown in how you scored a sick ass research project freshmen year, go to the gym five days a week, and take difficult classes, but it‚Äôs also shown in simpler ways. Making an effort to play a board game with your dad, cooking dinner for your mom, going to my family events with me. You are amazing, Erik.
	<br>
	In the future, I see us going down a lot of different paths. We could move to Oregon or Washington the fall after we graduate college, buy a small house, and get our first real jobs. We could live in Ann Arbor for a year as I finish up my Master‚Äôs. We could randomly take a gap year and move to Denmark (I like this option). We could live in Tulsa, get a cute little house, burn up in the heat, and have to take long showers twice a day. Whatever happens, the only consistent variable is us being together. You are it for me, Erik. I am 100% committed to you, and that doesn‚Äôt scare me to say honestly. Here‚Äôs to three years and many many more.
