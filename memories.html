        <h1>My Favorite Moments ðŸ’•</h1>
        <div><a href="index.html">Back to Home</a></div>
        <div class="memory">Our first date at the Owl!</div>
        <div class="memory">The time we had the picnic at the Arb, and we found our super secret spot in the clearing by the river. I remember laying back to back and never wanting to get up.</div>
        <div class="memory">When we painted our nails blue in your car after a robotics practice. Instead of just holding each other's hands, I thought it was a great idea to lay my hand on the side console.</div>
        <div class="memory">Our picnic at Lillie Park for your one month anniversary.</div>
        <div class="memory">Ice skating together for the first time! We happened to pick Buhr Park because it was convenient and have stuck with it since. It was also the first time you drove me and the first time we held hands.</div>
        <div class="memory">Taking walks in the <b>pouring</b> rain in Wilson park.</div>
        <div class="memory">Going to IHOP, sharing a strawberry  milkshake, and acting like complete idiots. (Part 1)</div>
        <div class="memory">Walking around Lillie Park, picking flowers and putting them in each other's hair, lying on a blanket together and laughing so hard, watching the sunset as we said we loved each other for the first time.</div>
        <div class="memory">Our first kiss under the trees at Wilson Park. I exclaimed "Oh shit" when you grabbed my face, your lips were soft. The song "Indirect Kiss" was playing.</div>
        <div class="memory">Cooking pancakes together in your kitchen. And green eggs. And lotssss of quesadillas. And really questionable paneer tikka masala.</div>
        <div class="memory">Sitting on your bedroom floor as you ran your hands through my hair and rubbed my back. Back then, we weren't as physical and that was like the best feeling in the world.</div>
        <div class="memory">Kissing on my bed in the Marvin Street house and being lowkey terrible at it but somehow still great.</div>
        <div class="memory">Eating together before theater in the red hallway.</div>
        <div class="memory">Every time you've beaten me at chess.</div>
        <div class="memory">When we tried to go roller skating but they said they "should be closed", so we got a yummy banana split anyway and had the best drive back.</div>
        <div class="memory">All of the befores and afters of the stupid school dances. Oooooh especially making out in your car after.</div>
        <div class="memory">Every time I watch you play piano.</div>
        <div class="memory">Every single time we got to try clothes on in the Target dressing room together.</div>
        <div class="memory">New year's eve kisses!</div>
        <div class="memory">New year's eve hotel!!!!</div>
        <div class="memory">Doing incredibly annoying set building projects together (like the cat stairs)</div>
        <div class="memory">Just lying in bed with you, me sitting in front of you, and watching tiktoks.</div>
        <div class="memory">Any time ever we've gotten to lie in bed together.</div>
        <div class="memory">Any time ever we've gotten to fall asleep together.</div>
        <div class="memory">The whole Tulsa trip! But I particularly liked our five showers, the really nice cozy first night where we ordered pizza and watched a show, watching the sunset on the library steps, when the uber drive told us to get in quick and scurted off to the mexican restaurant, and every other moment that weekend.</div>
        <div class="memory">Graduating together!</div>
        <div class="memory">The really really sweet trip to Greenfield village you planned. It was the best day ever. </div>
        <div class="memory">Getting to show you campus and all of my classes!</div>
        <div class="memory">When you came home for my birthday and we ate such good food, got to sleep together, went to Paesanos, and so much more. </div>
        <div class="memory">I love every memory with you my love. I can't wait for so many more.</div>
